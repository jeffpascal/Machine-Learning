# Deep Learning

## Neural Network

- Deep learning is about neural networks
- Interconnected web of nodes called neurons

### Forward propagation
- neural network way to classify by advancing through the nodes

### Pattern complexity

- Simple : SVM
- Moderate : Deep Nets outperform
- Complex : Deep net 

### Unsupervised Learning extract patterns from unlabeled data

- Pattern recognition
- Feature extraction

- Recommended DL: RBM, Autoencoders

### Labelled data

- Text processing RNTN, Recurrrent Net
- image Recognition
- Object Recognition
- Speech Recognition
